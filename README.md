# Thesis/Dissertation LaTeX Document(s)
My dissertation, defended to complete my PhD in Mathematics at The Ohio State University in April 2020. 

I invite any graduate students who need a LaTeX template compliant with OSU graduate college thesis formatting guidelines to use this as a starting point.



* ``a-Thesis.tex`` is the main file; this is the file I compiled to build the full document, and all the other files are meant to be included in this one.

* formatting presets are specified in ``b-frontmatter`` and ``b-mainmatter``

* macros/commands specific to the user are meant to be set in ``b-preamble``

* Content/chapters are in the ``c-`` files (note: as mentioned above, one can still compile the full document by compiling just ``a-thesis``)
