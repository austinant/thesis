\chapter{Abstract}

\chapter{Acknowledgements}
I owe my thanks to many, many people whose generosity and support have helped me immeasurably while I pursued this degree.

To my parents Deane and Kim, who have always encouraged me to do my best, flown me home for the holidays, and given me wisdom to help me navigate the world.

To my grandparents Fay and Al, who have shown me constant love and support.

To YiaYia, Jason, and Kyle, for hiding me safely away from work every Thanksgiving and July Fourth.

To Peter, for always making sure that I'm curious.

To my advisor, Alan Loper, for helping me to grow as a mathematician, for asking interesting questions, and for his patience.

To my collaborator, Salvo, for letting me work on such an interesting problem suited to my strengths, for being a thorough and thoughtful coathor, and for being a friend during my time in Austria.

To Alfred Geroldinger, whose work I greatly admire, for hosting me in Austria and for keeping factorization theory and combinatorial group theory fashionable.

To all my friends in the math department for productive (and not) discussions about math (and not).

To Alex and Michael, for many dinners together, for celebrating and commiserating together, and for having deeper than reasonable discussions of quite trivial things.

To Jared, for always checking in on me and for reminding me of all the wonderful, silly things that exist.
